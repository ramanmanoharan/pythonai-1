Machine Learning Basics

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Works with unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, Autoencoders

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learns through trial and error
   - Agent interacts with environment
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics

Common Algorithms:

Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values
Logistic Regression: Binary classification
Decision Trees: Tree-based decisions
Random Forest: Ensemble of decision trees
Neural Networks: Inspired by human brain
Support Vector Machines: Finds optimal hyperplane

Key Concepts:
- Training: Learning from data
- Testing: Evaluating model performance
- Overfitting: Model too complex, memorizes training data
- Underfitting: Model too simple, poor performance
- Cross-validation: Technique to assess model generalization

Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions
- Precision: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- Recall: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
