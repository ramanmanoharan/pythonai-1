Python Programming Guide

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

Key Features:
- Dynamic typing: Variables don't need explicit type declarations
- Indentation-based syntax: Code blocks are defined by indentation
- Object-oriented: Supports classes and inheritance
- Extensive standard library: Batteries included philosophy

Common Data Types:
1. Integers (int): Whole numbers like 42, -10
2. Floats (float): Decimal numbers like 3.14, -0.5
3. Strings (str): Text enclosed in quotes "hello"
4. Lists (list): Ordered collections [1, 2, 3]
5. Dictionaries (dict): Key-value pairs {"name": "John", "age": 30}

Control Flow:
- if/elif/else: Conditional statements
- for loops: Iterate over sequences
- while loops: Repeat while condition is true

Functions:
Define reusable code blocks with def keyword.
Example: def greet(name): return f"Hello {name}"

Popular Libraries:
- NumPy: Numerical computing
- Pandas: Data analysis
- Django/Flask: Web frameworks
- TensorFlow/PyTorch: Machine learning
